### Beginner developer

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning: Kotlin (Android development)
- âš¡ Plans to study: Java, Swift, Python. And other languages (To expand my worldview)
- Plans to create: Handy apps with a new look that will inspire and be used regularly


- I like the very concept of programming, when you create something from nothing.
And also I really like to constantly improve my result, each time doing something better than yesterday.
I love to learn, to look for new ideas / out of the box approaches from other developers, and in the world around me. It's inspiring
